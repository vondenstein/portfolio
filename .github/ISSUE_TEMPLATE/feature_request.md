**Disclamer**
Feature request approvals are highly subjective and may not be implemented due to feasibility or conflicts with the road map of the project. Being that this project started as a personal website for the creator, bug requests and crucial functionality updates will take precedence. Features deemed incompatible with the vision of the project will be removed.

For Christmas in 2023, Blake and I invited our parents to stay with us and celebrate the holidays
in Colorado Springs. We took the opportunity to take them on a tour of the city, eat at our
favorite restaurants, and enjoy their company in our new-_ish_ home. My Dad and I took a [train
to the top of Pikes Peak](https://www.cograilway.com/), everyone visited the Colorado Springs Zoo,
and we stopped by the
[Gaylord Rockies](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/dengr-gaylord-rockies-resort-and-convention-center/overview/)
for their Christmas-themed cirque. It was a great time, and we can't wait to have them over again!

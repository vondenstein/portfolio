In the fall of 2023, my wife Blake and I took an impromptu trip to Cripple Creek, CO to experience
the changing of the leaves along Phantom Canyon Road. We had a fun time making our way to Cripple
Creek, stopping for photos a few times along the way. This was my first time shooting
[Ektar 100](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/585497-USA/Kodak_6031330_35mm_Ektar_100_Color.html),
and I'll definitely be adding it to my arsenal after seeing the beautiful color rendition in these
photos. We can't wait to return to Phantom Canyon to enjoy some camping and stargazing!

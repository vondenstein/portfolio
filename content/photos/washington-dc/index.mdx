After graduating college, my good friend Thomas accepted a job in Reston, Virginia. I offered to
accompany him on the drive up from Louisiana, and we decided to make a vacation out of it. We made
our way through the Smoky Mountains and up to Washington, DC and took some wonderful photos in the
process. I will always look at these photos with bittersweet emotions because - while this trip was
one of my favorites - it represents a time in which a bunch of college friends grew up and moved
away to pursue greener pastures.

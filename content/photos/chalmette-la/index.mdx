When I was in college, I worked as a wedding photographer and videographer with [Andrew Bui](https://www.neworleans.com/new-orleans-local-influencers/andrew-bui/). Many times, we had to drive across the state (or one time, the country) to reach the wedding venue, and we would usually stop to take some photos along the way.

This time, we stopped in Chalmette, LA after seeing an interesting location for photos while driving. I love the setting of this photoset - the grass in the first photo looks like a velvet-y carpet, the rainy sky gives the whole set a moody feel, and the lack of eye contact adds a sense of mystery.

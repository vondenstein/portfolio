For our first wedding anniversary, Blake and I booked an Alaskan cruise. The cruise departed from
Vancouver, so we spent a little bit of time exploring the city for a few hours before boarding. I
brought a Canon AF35ML point-and-shoot film camera with me, and took a few photos during our short
Canadian adventure. I hope to eventually return to this beautiful city, as there simply wasn't
enough time to capture its beauty on film!

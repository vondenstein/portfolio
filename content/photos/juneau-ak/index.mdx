My wife, Blake, and I embarked on an Alaskan cruise to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.
As we made our way along the Alaskan coast, our ship stopped at Icy Strait Point, which is where
the last two photos were taken. I fell ill towards the end of the trip and was unable to take as
many photos as I had hoped, but I managed to disembark in Juneau to take some photos of the
beautiful coast of Alaska before spending the remainder of the trip in our stateroom.

I had been saving some Portra 400 for this trip, and I was pleasantly surprised with how it
rendered the misty Alaskan mountains. If we return to Alaska, I will definitely be packing Portra in my bag.

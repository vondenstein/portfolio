### Issues With the T61

The ThinkPad T61 unfortunately fell victim to a manufacturing issue that plagued certain NVIDIA GPUs. Lenovo and NVIDIA eventually started to fix the problem, but the new boards didn't go into production until late 2008. Unfortunately, production on the T61 line stopped in late 2008 as well, so only a small number of the updated motherboards were produced. The motherboard on the device that I purchased seems okay for now, but I may eventually get an updated board just to be sure.

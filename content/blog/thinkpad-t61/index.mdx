Playing computer games as a kid is one of the reasons I became interested in computers in the first place. At the time, the operating system of choice was the venerated Windows XP.

## Why Use Real Vintage Hardware?

Realistically, I probably should've just installed Windows XP in a virtual machine, downloaded old games from the internet, and called it a day. I decided to purchase a period-correct Windows XP machine and a bunch of old game discs because I wanted the full nostalgia experience. I must've installed XP at least 20 times during my childhood, and I wanted to experience that process again - the excitement of opening a game box and reading the manual while the game gets slowly copied from one spinning disc to another. Well maybe not that last part - I'm going to toss an SSD in there to speed things up a bit, but I wanted to experience everything else just as it would've been in 2007.

### Issues With the T61

The ThinkPad T61 unfortunately fell victim to a manufacturing issue that plagued certain NVIDIA GPUs. Lenovo and NVIDIA eventually started to fix the problem, but the new boards didn't go into production until late 2008. Unfortunately, production on the T61 line stopped in late 2008 as well, so only a small number of the updated motherboards were produced. The motherboard on the device that I purchased seems okay for now, but I may eventually get an updated board just to be sure.

Hi, I'm Stephen. If you don't know me very well, I'd encourage you to check out my [bio](/bio) to take a peek into my life and how I operate.

Back? Great! Now that you have an understanding of who I am and what drives me, let's dive into what this site is and why it exists - a sort of 'what to expect when you're expecting' for readers of this blog.

## Imposter syndrome

## Sharing is caring

## Hall of memories

Looking back over previous experiences is an imporant part of growth, both personal and professional. After all, how can we truly learn from our past if we don't take the time to review our experiences and internalize the conclusions we came to? That most of the posts on this site will be technical in nature does not detract from them as catalysts for self-reflection.

In software development, learning isn't optional - it's essential. Many software engineers started with the desire to create something new with technology. The first step? To learn how to code. They picked a language - like Python - and started learning enough to create a 'hello world' program. With this under their belt, they likely chose a slightly more ambitious project and spent time reading documentation to gain the knowledge required to build it. After that? Maybe building a web app sounded exciting, so they chose to learn about web development with React. Or, maybe they wanted to learn iOS development. And so on. You get the gist.

Throughout all of this constant learning, most developers find themseleves thinking deeply about their work. They may ask themselves, "Is there a faster way to accomplish this?" or "I remember solving a similar problem a week ago. Does that same solution apply here?" In the case of the second question, they might find themselves looking back at previously written code, trying to remember what thought process brought them to the solution, hoping that similar logic could be applied to the current problem. Such is the importance of peering back into one's previous work - it gives a starting point for solving future problems, and helps refine the thought process.

In this way, it makes sense to approach this site as a sort of journal.

## About This Site

This site is my personal space On The Line™. I write about things, link to interesting material, and 
showcase projects I've done/built/designed. My written content is purely personal in nature and does not
necessarily reflect the views of my employer, my University (Geaux Tigers), or any complex AI I've written
now or in the future.

It lives here: [vondenstein.com](http://vondenstein.com)

In addition to software development, another creative outlet I've been excited to explore is photography.   
The photographs used on my site are taken by me in my free time. Feel free to check out my Instagram, 
[shvphoto](http://instagram.com/shvphoto), as many of my images are posted there. While I have also
designed most of the graphics used on this site, a small minority are licensed from others, namely Adobe. 
Definitely have a look at Adobe Stock, as they have a great collection of stock images and graphics.

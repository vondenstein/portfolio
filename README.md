## ❓ About This Project

This site is my personal space On The Line™. I showcase my projects, share life experiences, and shed light on things I find interesting - whether it be new music, or a helpful new tool I've found. My written content is personal in nature and does not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, my University (Geaux Tigers), or anyone I've collaborated with on projects and products.

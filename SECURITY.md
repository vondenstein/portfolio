# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions before 2.0.0 will no longer be supported because the project moved to Gatsby in version 2.0.0. Only the Gatsby version of the project will be supported going forward.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, submit an issue with 'VULNERABILITY' as the subject.
Issues regarding security vulnerabilities will be prioritized over new features and other bugfixes. 
Note that this project is a personal project, not a professional project, - I'll get to issues as soon as I can, but I can't make any guarantees as far as response time.

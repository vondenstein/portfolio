Hi! If you want to learn more about me, you came to the right place.
<br><br>
I'm a computer science student at Louisiana State University with a knack for software development and design. My favorite projects are those that challenge me to build upon my problem-solving skills while maintaining my chops as a developer. I've spent time working at a startup where I helped build a AI-assisted image editing web application. I've also gained experience building and training complex neural networks in and outside of the classroom, as well as building and deploying web applications with React.JS and GraphQL.
<br><br>
I'm looking for new opportunities to learn and collaborate with other talented engineers. Other than building software, I most enjoy connecting with people who share my passion for engineering and clean design.
<br><br>
When I'm waiting for builds to compile, I like to pursue a few other hobbies - my favorite being photography. If you'd like to check out my photos, you can find them [here](https://instagram.com/vondensteins).

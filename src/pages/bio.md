Hi! If you want to learn more about me, you came to the right place.

I'm a computer science student at Louisiana State University with a knack for software development and design. My favorite projects are those that challenge me to build upon my problem-solving skills while maintaining my chops as a developer. To that end, I worked as a student programmer at LSU automating virtualization workflows and contributing to cybersecurity research. I've also gained experience building and training complex neural networks in and outside of the classroom.

I'm now looking for new opportunities to learn and collaborate with other talented engineers. Other than creating new things with computers, I most enjoy connecting with people who share my passion for engineering and clean design. If that sounds like you, please reach out to me using the links above or below!

When I'm waiting for builds to compile, I like to pursue a few other hobbies - my favorite being photography. If you'd like to check out my photos, you can find them here. I hope to dedicate a page on this site to my photos soon.

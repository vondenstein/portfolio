    <h1>If you want to learn more about me, you came to the right place.</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a computer science student at Louisiana State University with a knack
      for software development and design. My favorite projects are those that
      challenge me to build upon my problem-solving skills while maintaining my
      chops as a developer. To that end, I worked as a student programmer at LSU
      automating virtualization workflows and contributing to cybersecurity
      research. I've also gained experience building and training complex neural
      networks in and outside of the classroom. I'm now looking for new
      opportunities to learn and collaborate with other talented engineers.
      Other than creating new things with computers, I most enjoy connecting
      with people who share my passion for engineering and clean design. If that
      sounds like you, please reach out to me using the links above or below!
      When I'm waiting for builds to compile, I like to pursue a few other
      hobbies - my favorite being photography. If you'd like to check out my
      photos, you can find them here. I hope to dedicate a page on this site to
      my photos soon.
